<h2>Project Background</h2>

<p>
The goal of the project was to build a budget USB JTAG adapter. Basically
it should allow direct I/O access to the JTAG signals from an USB host, but
additionally implement some sort of parallel/serial conversion as well for
higher transfer rates. While a combination of USB I/O device like FTDI FT245BM
with a custom logic for the parallel/serial conversion could be used, I started
with a prototype implementation in software on a Cypress EZ-USB FX2 controller.
That happens to be the controller in a device manufactured by my employer,
where it is used to configure an Altera Cyclone device. That gave me a nice
platform for testing.
</p><p>
On the USB side, it now uses the same protocol as Altera's USB-Blaster. The
drivers that I developed for my adapter do work with the Blaster as well. To
the host PC, the only really noticeable difference are vendor and product ID 
and the product description string (0x16C0/0x06AD/USB-JTAG-IF instead of
0x9FB/0x6001/USB-Blaster).
</p>

<h2>Myth busting</h2>
<h3>USB JTAG isn't USB JTAG</h3>
<p>
There are so many "USB JTAG adapters" and all are different and usually
incompatible. There's no single "USB JTAG" standard. There even may exist 
many different USB JTAG adapters for the same target hardware, but which
are incompatible to each other with regard to the software on the host.
</p>
<p>
You should first look for a development software that is right for your
target. And then, afterwards, look for an USB JTAG adapter that is compatible
with that software. The adapter presented here is compatible with openwince and
OpenOCD, and easily can be made compatible with Altera software. But on the
other hand, openwince works better with generic parallel port adapters, and
OpenOCD works better with FT2232-based adapters. See the OpenOCD page for more
info about that.
</p>
<h3>USB JTAG adapters aren't necessarily faster than parallel port adapters</h3>
<p>
In fact, higher bit rates are possible - but not necessarily with every given
USB adapter just because it works over USB. It also depends on the host
software; it has to be written so that it specifically supports USB adapters.
If you connect a parallel port adapter through an "USB to parallel port
converter", it'll be dead slow. But that's not the fault of the parallel port
adapter...</p>
<p> The adapter presented here is (circa) as fast as a parallel port
adapter with proper software. You'll probably prefer it over a parallel port
solution anyway, simply because many hosts (especially notebooks) nowadays
don't have a parallel port anymore and USB connectors are less bulky...
</p>
<h3>Why use this one?</h3>
<p>
A reason to consider my design can be (at least) one of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>You're looking for an USB JTAG adapter that can be used with openwince
or Altera software</li>
<li>You already have a Cypress FX2 USB Controller in your design that you want
to use to control other devices via JTAG.</li>
<li>You're curious to find out how a FX2 is able to (partially) emulate a FTDI FT245.</li>
</ul>

<del>usb_jtag-20080705-1200.zip</del> [<a href="http://ixo-jtag.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/ixo-jtag/usb_jtag/trunk/">this has moved</a>]
(contains all C and VHDL sources for firmware, logic, and driver patches)
</li>
</ul>
<p>
A patch for <a href="http://openocd.berlios.de/web/">OpenOCD</a> is included
in the ZIP. It doesn't contain an openwince JTAG tools patch any more, because
<a href="http://urjtag.org">UrJTAG</a>, the successor to the openwince JTAG
tools, has this support integrated out of the box! Note: by default, the code
looks for an adapter with Altera's USB-Blaster vendor/product ID (from the
driver's view, the only difference between the adapters is the ID).  To detect
an adapter with my ID instead, additional configuration is needed.</p>
<h2>News</h2>
<p>
2008-07: I've prepared a new ZIP. The only actual enhancement is an updated patch for
OpenOCD (thanks Anthony Liu) and removal of the openwince JTAG tools patch in favor of
UrJTAG.
</p>
<p>2007-11: The <a href="http://www.urjtag.org">UrJTAG project</a> now hosts an up-to-date and
actively developed version of the jtag tools (formerly openwince jtag tools). My supporting code for
the USB-Blaster, my own adapter, and Xilinx cable are integrated and already got some more bugs fixed.</p>
<p>
2007-02: I have taken the USRP firmware from the <a href="http://gnuradio.org">GNU Radio Project</a>
to construct a new FX2 firmware that can be built with <a href="http://sdcc.sourceforge.net">SDCC</a>
instead of Keil tools. I hope I'll be able to make it more portable, so in the future maybe it can
be built for Silicon Labs and Cypress chips as you like. Summary of new features in this release:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Written to be compiled with SDCC, not Keil</li>
  <li>On-the-fly computation of "EEPROM" contents from the descriptor data (with checksum)</li>
  <li>Better support in code layout for different hardware</li>
  <li>Can be built to run on Xilinx Spartan-3E Starter Kit and possibly Platform Cable USB</li>
</ul>
<p>
2007-01: The "notes" about <a href="#xilinx">using my firmware on a Xilinx Platform Cable USB</a> have been
extended and now contain a link to download a basic openwince patch to support
the Xilinx cable directly (with original firmware and CPLD code)
</p>
<p>
2007-01: A new release ZIP has been prepared. It contains all firmware source code, logic definitions
and the driver code for OpenOCD and openwince JTAG. Some sections that previously were on this page now
can be found in readme files within the ZIP file.
</p>

<h2>Hardware suggestions</h2>

<p>
Below, three different hardware variants are shown in principle. Two are based
on intelligent USB microcontrollers, one makes use of FTDI's FT245
USB-to-parallel chip.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, I do not have the time to present finished schematics for either
variant of the USB JTAG adapter. As the source is quite incomplete anyway, if
you're using it you're probably one of those people who easily can make up
their own schematics. In principle, they are like the drawings below (best
viewed with fixed-width font!). Add power supply, voltage regulator(s), level
shifter, termination resistors, and more, as required...
</p>
<h3>Variant A: Cypress FX2</h3>

<h3>Variant B: FTDI FT245 plus CPLD</h3>
<pre>
Using FTDI FT245BM plus EEPROM 93C46 plus CPLD EPM7064

              _________
             |         |

              __|__________    _|___________
             |             |  |             |
             | 6 MHz XTAL  |  | 24 MHz Osc. |
             |_____________|  |_____________|

</pre>
<p>
Note: The newer FT245R has on-chip EEPROM and oscillator, so the 93C46 and 6 MHz XTAL
aren't needed anymore. Furthermore it can output 12 MHz on OSCO; it maybe possible
to use the clock for the EPM7064 (then running at half the original speed).
</p><p>
A working implementation with CPLD can be seen in the upper right of 
<a href="eb2_usbjtag_eth.jpg">this picture</a>,
connected to an Altium Live Design Evaluation Board EB2, Cyclone Edition,
instead of the parallel port cable. The board at the bottom of the picture was a
PCI Ethernet card. I desoldered the PCI MAC chip and instead wired the PHY directly to 
the EB2; to evaluate OpenCores Ethernet MAC in the FPGA. USB has been added
as a <a href="wired_isp1106.jpg">module with just an USB transceiver</a> and 
48 MHz oscillator on it, driven by OpenCores.org USB 1.1 function core.
</p>
<h3>Variant C: SiLabs C8051F32x</h3>
<pre>
Using Silicon Laboratories C8051F32x with firmware in integrated flash (unfinished)

              ____________
             |            |
             | SiLabs     |
        USB__| C8051F32x  |__JTAG(TDI,TDO,TCK,TMS)
             |____________|
 
</pre>
<p>
Variant C isn't finished yet. I first tried to implement it on a C8051F326, after I 
<a href="wired_f326.jpg">managed to wire up such a chip</a> to a demo board (the "Toolstick-EK"). It
turned out that a F326 isn't suited for this task because it can't have an EP2 OUT as the FT245
uses. However, the F321 should work, and my next goal is to build a replacement firmware for
the "Toolstick Base Adapter with Debug Adapter". Thanks to Ricky who's working on the 
<a href="http://ec2drv.sourceforge.net">EC2DRV project</a>; he's already has been a great help
while finding out how to upload firmware to the Toolstick.
</p>

<h2><a name="xilinx"></a>Xilinx Platform Cable USB (DLC9)</h2>
<h3>Also known as "Variant D"...</h3>

<p>
The Xilinx cable, "XPCU", consists of a CY7C68013A (FX2) plus CPLD. With a
little research about the CPLD functions, I was able to adapt my firmware so it
can be run on the XPCU. The necessary changes are included in the latest release
above. In theory, it is possible to turn the XPCU into an USB-Blaster using that
firmware ;) - I practically tested it on the Spartan-3E starter kit (with
embedded "cable"). The CPLD doesn't have to be modified.
</p>
<p>
While working with it, I also wrote an experimental driver for openwince to
support the XPCU with original Xilinx firmware and CPLD. That code has now been
merged into <a href="http://urjtag.org">UrJTAG</a>, therefore there's no
separate download available here anymore.</p>

<h2>JTAG Tracing</h2>

<p>
In order to trace what's happening on the JTAG chain at the adapter, I've
written this small Perl script <a href="lusbb_decode-20060903.pl">lusbb_decode-20060903.pl</a>.
It is able to interpret log files from
<a href="http://www.hhdsoftware.com/usbmon.html">HHD's USB Monitor</a>
or Linux kernel messages from OpenOCD with libftd2xx or Altera's jtagd and show you
the actual IR and DR scans.  It does not work yet with libftdi. With kernel
2.6, you can enable those messages using the command
</p>
<pre>
  echo 1 &gt; /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_snoop
</pre>
